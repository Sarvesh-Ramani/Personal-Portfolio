The previous AI engineer developed a full-stack portfolio application using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database). The process started with building a multi-page frontend with mock data, incorporating a modern, clean design, mobile responsiveness, and subtle animations. Key features include Home, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact pages, displaying professional information.

A runtime error on the Experience page was fixed by adding a missing  import. Dark/light mode functionality was implemented, though it required multiple iterations to ensure consistent application across all pages and correct font colors, especially after a user-requested design refresh inspired by Apple/Notion aesthetics.

The application was then converted to a full-stack architecture, migrating from mock data to a live FastAPI backend with MongoDB, including CRUD operations and data seeding.

Most recently, the focus shifted to making the application deployment-ready for Netlify. This involved resolving several build failures related to incorrect file paths, missing

found 0 vulnerabilities in the build command, Node.js version incompatibility (React Router DOM v7+ requires Node 20+), and dependency conflicts (specifically  and ). After resolving these, the user reported that while deployment succeeded, the Home, Skills, and Projects sections were not loading. The AI engineer identified this as a backend dependency issue in a frontend-only Netlify deployment and began re-integrating mock data for these sections, while also starting work on professional gamification as requested by the user.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, clean, mobile-responsive, and engaging multi-page portfolio website. It needed a professional color scheme, easy navigation, subtle animations/hover effects, and should highlight the user's unique value proposition. Initial pages included Home, About, Skills, Experience, Projects (with placeholders), and Contact.

Key updates and bug fixes included:
1.  **Experience Page Fix**: A runtime error on the Experience page was reported and fixed (missing  icon import).
2.  **Dark/Light Mode**: Requested as an alternative viewing option, this feature was implemented and iteratively refined to ensure consistent application across all pages and proper font color handling.
3.  **Full-Stack Integration**: Transition from mock data to a complete full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB database, including CRUD operations.
4.  **Content Refinement**: Removal of System Architecture from Experience, reordering of technologies on the Home page (Java/Spring Boot first, then Python), updating copyright year to 2025, and changing location to Chennai from Coimbatore. LinkedIn profile was provided for content reference.
5.  **Deployment Readiness**: The application needed to be deployable from GitHub to platforms like Netlify.
6.  **Deployment Bug Fixes**: Multiple Netlify build failures were reported and addressed, related to incorrect paths, Node.js version incompatibility, and dependency conflicts.
7.  **Frontend-Only Deployment Adaption**: After a successful Netlify deploy, Home, Skills, and Project sections failed to load due to missing backend, requiring a switch back to mock data for these sections.
8.  **Gamification**: The user requested to gamify the portfolio experience with a professional touch.

**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React application component, handles routing and global context.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup with  and . Integrated . Modified to fetch data from  instead of initial mock data.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Individual page components (Home, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact).
    -   **Changes**: Initially built with mock data. Updated to integrate  for dark/light mode, applying specific Tailwind CSS classes for theme adaptation. Modified to fetch data from .  had a missing  import fixed. Content and styling were updated multiple times based on user feedback and new design guidelines, including removal of System Architecture and location updates.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Centralized service for API calls to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle  requests to the FastAPI backend. Currently being modified to serve mock data again for specific pages due to frontend-only deployment issues.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores initial mock data for frontend development.
    -   **Changes**: Used extensively during initial frontend-only development. Replaced by backend calls, but now being re-integrated for certain sections due to deployment constraints.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend application, defines API routes and handles database interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Initial hello world. Expanded with Pydantic models and CRUD endpoints for  and other portfolio data (e.g., Experience, Skills, Projects, Education, Certifications). Configured CORS.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for request/response validation and data structure for MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Created with models for , , , , , , , , etc., mirroring the portfolio content.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Documents API endpoints, data models, and integration strategy.
    -   **Changes**: Created to outline backend implementation and frontend-backend integration after initial frontend development.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides theme (dark/light mode) context to the React application.
    -   **Changes**: Created to manage theme state and provide a toggle function.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Netlify deployment configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly modified multiple times to fix deployment issues: corrected  and  paths, added

<current_work>
Currently, the previous AI engineer was addressing a critical issue where, after successful Netlify deployment, the Home, Skills, and Projects sections of the portfolio were not opening. This was identified as a problem arising from these sections attempting to fetch data from a backend API that does not exist in a frontend-only Netlify hosting environment.

To resolve this, the engineer began modifying the  file. The intent is to switch the data source for these specific pages back to use mock data, ensuring they function correctly without a dedicated backend.

Simultaneously, the engineer is tasked with incorporating professional gamification elements into the portfolio experience, which will be integrated once the data fetching issue for the affected pages is resolved. The trajectory ends as the engineer is in the process of updating , and is about to proceed with changes to  and  to reflect both the mock data usage and the new gamification features.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update  to ensure the Home, Skills, and Projects pages use mock data, and then apply professional gamification to these sections.
